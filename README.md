2d collision test for game-development in rust (with optional integration and example for bevy)

This provides a low-level "narrow-phase" collision-detection logic,
with some integration for the [bevy] game engine (behind feature flag).

If you want to pair it with a broad-phase, you may look at [bvh-arena] or [broccoli].

[bevy]: https://bevyengine.org
[bvh-arena]: https://github.com/jcornaz/bvh-arena
[broccoli]: https://github.com/tiby312/broccoli


## Roadmap

* [x] collision test (GJK implementation)
* [ ] collision shapes
  * [x] circle
  * [x] rectangle
  * [ ] convex-hull
  * [ ] capsule
* [x] contact generation (EPA implementation)


## Usage example

```rust
use impacted::{CollisionShape, Transform};
use glam::Vec2; // <-- use any math library you like

// Create a circle
let circle = CollisionShape::new_circle(1.0);

// Create a rectangle
let mut rect = CollisionShape::new_rectangle(4.0, 4.0)
    .with_transform(Transform::from_translation(Vec2::new(2.0, 0.0)));

// Test for collision
assert!(circle.is_collided_with(&rect));
```

You may also look in the [examples](https://github.com/jcornaz/impacted/tree/main/examples) directory
for more complete/concrete usage examples (e.g. using the bevy engine)
